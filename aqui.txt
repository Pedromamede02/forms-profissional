  <h2>You have ten (10) points per question to distribute between the eight endings
    in accordance with how they accurately reflect the way that you believe behave in teams.
    If you think they all describe your behaviour pretty well, then you will probably
    assign your points fairly evenly across them all. However, you may decide that one
    describes you perfectly and give all ten to one ending. Most people fall in between
    these two extremes. You can allocate 0 to some endings.
